## Communication Plan

  > * Use Slack as needed.
  > * Be in classroom as needed & through lunch if available.
  > * Prioritize main functionality of site before stretch goals & design.

## Work Plan

*Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.*

> * Utilize Trello to break down tasks into small, manageable chunks.
> * Take ownership of task/feature you feel confident working on, but be mindful of time-boxing and speaking up when struggling for too long.
> * Try Pair-Programming when stuck on a feature.

_____

* What is your Git flow?
  > Work on branches.
* Will you be using a PR review workflow?
  > Yes.
