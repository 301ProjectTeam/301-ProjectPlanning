## Problem Domain

For the sandwich aficionado, the search for the best of the best is not as easy as one might expect. The category seems dismissed as minor foodfare and an avid sandwich lover is stuck with endless google searches to find the 'finest' in a location they can patronize. 

This website/app will allow the user to locate the absolute best sandwich in each state of the US. It will also provide a forum for sandwich lovers to share where they had their best sandwich experience.
